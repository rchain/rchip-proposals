<!-- This document is provided as a template to get you started. Feel free to add, augment, remove, restructure and otherwise adapt the structure for what you need. -->

<!-- Note: RCHIP-NN prefix and number in the title is assigned when proposal is approved. -->

## Introduction/Motivation/Abstract
<!-- Feel free to rename this section to Introduction, Motivation, Abstract, whatever best suits your proposal. -->


## Motivating Examples

### Examples
<!-- Detailed description of how the enhancement functionality can be used.
Code heavy description for Rholang related features. -->

### Comparison Examples
<!-- Code demonstrating why the library is needed, how equivalent functionality might be provided without it. -->

### Counter-Examples
<!-- What the library is not intended to be used for. Examples of what to avoid and why. -->


## Design
<!-- Discuss design decisions (including, as examples):
* Reason about correctness of the implementation.
* “Feel and fit” with existing Rholang code.
* Performance and threading considerations.
* Impact to existing blockchain networks, hard fork conditions, etc. -->


## Counter-Examples
<!-- What the library is not intended to be used for. Examples of what to avoid and why. -->


## Drawbacks
<!-- Why should we not do this. Be honest, these questions will come out during the process anyway so it’s better to get them out up front. -->


## Alternatives
<!-- What other possibilities have been examined? What is the impact of not implementing this proposal? -->
